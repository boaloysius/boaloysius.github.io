Hi all, the last week was really a great experience. It is the first time that I have spend much time to learn Machine Learning to learn all the hypes in deep learning. I have some prior experience with Machine Learning while working for an internship at IIT Kanpur, creating a <a href="https://github.com/boaloysius/Decision-Tree-Classifier">Decision Tree Classifier</a>.

Week 1,
I have covered <a href="numpy.ipython">Numpy, Matplotlib</a>, <a href="linear_regression.ipython">Linear Regression</a> and <a href="logistic_regression.ipython">Logistic Regression</a>
